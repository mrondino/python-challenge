Project Title: Module 3 Assignment - python-challenge

Description: This script calls in two different CSV files and runs through them to gather certain information.

File Structure: The main.py contains the script that should be run. The "Resources" folder contains the CSV file that will be called in, and the "analysis" folder contains the txt file that will be outputted.

Code Source: I utlized the Xpert Learning Assistant to assist me in finding the syntax to use when exporting the text file for the PyPoll. I also found the carage return \n function from the internet to help space out the txt file better. 

Author: Myself, Madeline Rondino.
